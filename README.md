# Collection Manager
## Use your browser to instantly analyze your MTG Arena collection. No downloads. No loading.

## How to use the Collection Manager:
1. Upload your Player Log file (see the help page for help finding it!)
2. See your collection progress for every set.

## Features:
* It's like, *really, really* fast. Analyze over 250,000 cards as fast as you can click upload.
* No downloads necessary.
* Native dark mode, or optionally blind yourself with light mode.
* View every card that you own, see which ones you're missing, or check out whole sets at a time.
* Conveniently view your gold, gems, wildcards, and vault progress while the game's not open.
* Breakdown your progress for every rarity in every set set.
* Toggle between the current standard sets and all historic sets with one click.
* Customize your search -- try looking only for rare, white Angels, that don't come in a booster pack, only from the Kaldheim set. Be as specific as you want!
* See how many drafts it'll take to earn every rare or mythic, just enter your match win rate. **No** fumbling with "the average number of wins before you get three losses."
    * Compare different draft formats, see which one will get you ever card with the least gold or gems spent.
    * View your draft rewards. What win rate do you need to hit to go infinite? (Hint: It's about 68% if you're playing Premier. **And** you get 346 free packs to boot!)
* See how many boosters you need to complete each set.
* Want to see more cards at a time? Zoom out! You can always click the cards to get a bigger view.
* Try out keyboard shortcuts! The site is fully keyboard accessible.
    * In the large card view - Use the arrow keys to quickly navigate between cards, hit escape to exit the large view, and flip double-sided cards with the space bar!

## Coming Soon:
* Deck Builder

## Stay tuned for the full release planned August 2nd, 2021!
