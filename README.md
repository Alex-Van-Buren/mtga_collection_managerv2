### Automatic collection tracking not currently available
* If/when WotC adds collection data back into Arena's log files, automatic tracking will be added again.

### How to use the Collection Manager:
1. Upload your Player Log file (see the help page for help finding you logs).
2. See your collection progress for every set.
3. View, modify, and build decks using the deck builder.

### Features:
* See what cards you own and which ones you're missing for every set in MTG Arena.
   * Look up cards by name, rarity, color, mana cost, set, how many you own, card type (e.g. creatures), and whether they're available from booster packs.
* Use the booster and draft calculators to see how many more booster packs or drafts you need to complete your collection.
* View your vault progress, number of wildcards, gold, and gems.
* Use the deck builder to build new decks or modify existing ones.
   * Supports specific card versions (e.g. specify the STA version of Shock instead of whatever Shock is arbitrarily chosen by MTG Arena)
   * Save your decks to file to use later or copy them to your clipboard to immediately use them in game
   * Import decks from file or paste them in from your clipboard
   * Try out the "Limited" mode to edit your draft decks
